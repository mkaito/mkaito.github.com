During my usual morning rss browsing while having my ritual morning tea, I came across "this impressive post":http://psd.tutsplus.com/articles/inspiration/running-like-clockwork-steampunk-art-to-inspire-you/ on PSDtuts. I follow half the tutsplus network on my feed reader, and the inspirational post on this particular site of theirs are always quite impressive. However, a fan of steampunk art couldn't just walk by unimpressed at such an array of impressive steampunk pieces. If you're into steampunk, do not hesitate to visit. If you're not into steampunk, shun you, curse you, and slap you, and then you please go see it anyway.
