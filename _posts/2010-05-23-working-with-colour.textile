Colours have always been one of my pet peeves. Getting colours to play nice together in an image is apparently something my brain can't handle. But the time has come to work on this, and what better way to tackle it than working on your website? Right now, everything is white-and-grey and looks clean but boring.

The shade of grey used is very pleasant, almost-black-but-not-quite-black, which gives the page this matt look I'm so fond of, like an unpolished surface. And I've also always been a lover of orange. Not just "any" orange, but strong, red-ish orange. %{color: #ed1400; font-weight: 800;}This% sort of orange. It stands out strong against the dull, dark grey I picked as background, and makes for a very good contrast colour. As a third "colour", I'm going to use white... Or maybe I should just finally realize that white is not a colour, but the absence thereof. Either way, white seems to fit in nicely as a content background. I think I'm going to leave it like this for now, and hope a fourth colour comes to mind as I keep looking at the site for the next few days.

But what am I going to use these colours on? Really, I only have one colour to work with. The dark grey is serving as a page background, and by using white for the content frame, the whole thing starts looking kind of like a polaroid picture.
