I got into UI modding for Everquest 2 a while ago, mainly by modifying other people's work to my liking, removing some padding, adding a little button... But soon I realized that I edited almost every window, for one thing or another, in the same direction. Simplicity. Clarity. Overview.

I've always disliked all the cluttered UI mods, that ship with every feature under the sun, and then some. Nobody is ever interested in all that. But mods rarely let you choose what to display either, so you end up with either too much or too little information on screen. Building flexible UI mods is very complex, mainly because the framework doesn't allow for per-character settings beside top-level window size, position and opacity, so modders have to be very creative to allow some on-the-fly customization of their UI elements.

However, I think it's the developer's duty to provide as much flexibility as possible to the user, instead of locking them into a predefined configuration. But how to achieve the desired level of flexibility? This is one of the questions I aim to solve with Haiku.

As the name suggests, I want to focus on simplicity, probably minimalism. The interface should be as simple as possible, hiding all the complexity from the user. Preferrably, a simple settings dialog should be used instead of using the cryptic frame and title bar stuff.

The whole thing is an idea I'm mentally fleshing out right now, but I've already set up the "repo":http://github.com/mkaito/haiku-ui on github, and you can track progress there.

For now, I have made a pretty compelling threat meter window, with included auto attack bars, which is meant to be stuck below or above the casting bar, for which I have made a visually fitting mod aswell.

Thread window with auto-attack timer, with seceondary threat visible.

Right now, I'm still thinking of a visual style for windows, but I'm really fond of Dragowulf's Vex skin, which is simple and slick. I'll probably come up with something similar. I'm also looking at making several UI elements look more "plain" instead of so much pseudo 3D, which should reduce visual clutter a lot.
