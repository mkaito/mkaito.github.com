It's been bothering me quite a bit of late. I've gotten used to have Google at my finger tips, for everything. How did you write "lasagna" again? Did Ruby arrays have a pop method? What was the name of that song? Anything. It's been a few years, and I've come to rely on Google as my memory. I don't need to remember anything, because as long as I retain a glimpse of what it was I had to remember, Google will bring it up right away. I have to say, my Google-fu is black-belt level. I dare you to challenge me. Well, not now, I'm busy writing an article about... Wait what was I talking about?

## Lazy, lazy online

Having all the information humanity has ever wished for at your finger tips is quite handy. It really is. But it also makes you lazy. And I'm not liking where it's getting me. I have a horrible memory, and it's only getting worse with every day I spend working online. Behold, the Offline Days.

The concept is very simple, but empowering. While doing work, be it programming, or whatever, I am to not touch the browser, unless I happen to need it because I'm making a website. There's no Google, no Wikipedia, no quickly reachable language reference. I only allow myself to take on books, of the printed kind, as reference. And I have to say, it works. My memory is getting better with every hour I spend like that. In fact, I'm offline right now, although involuntarily, since my ISP has decided to give me the finger momentarily. I'm not reading up on facts to back my article, nor doing research on alternate memory training methods that would make this pointless. And this has to be the shortest amount of time I've ever invested in an article. The timer app says 30 minutes, over three sessions of 10 minutes, on different days. Most of my articles have taken north of 20 hours to write. Ridiculous.
